Fender won our hearts when we first read about him in the news.

Fender was struck by a vehicle and left for dead on the side of the highway at only 6 months of age. Fortunately, a good Samaritan picked him up and delivered him to the animal shelter.

While the owner was found, they relinquished him to the SPCA. 

Fender had a shattered leg, pelvis and both femoral heads. This poor pup has undergone orthopedic surgery to repair his leg, plates put in and both femoral heads removed. 
Throughout the ordeal he has remained sweet, positive and very friendly to everyone he meets, despite being in immeasurable pain.
This smart & gentle boy has already been such a trooper through it all. 

Now that his surgeries are all done, Derek and I have decided to foster him. All he needs now is time, love, and a bit of physical therapy over the next few months.
This sweet boy is an absolute joy to have in our home.
We've created this little place on the interwebs to keep everyone up to date on his progress and ...basically...to post adorable pup photos!

I think if Fender could talk he would want to say, thank-you to everyone who donated for his care without ever meeting him, to all the vets and technicians who went above and beyond for him and to the BCspca for rescuing him. 
We live in an awesome community!
